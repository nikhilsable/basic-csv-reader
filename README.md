# basic-csv-reader

hi!

 - This is a simple python project that takes a .csv file as an input and iterates through it to return a list of lines (split on \n)
 - How to run the testcsvreader.py file?
  -Download to local env, fire up command line, run the file in the location: for ex-
    -sudo python testcsvreader.py test.csv
    - Where, <<test.csv>> could be any .csv file
 -I've included a sample test.csv file, that is basically a dump of the passenger list for the Titanic along with passenger details (credit goes to Kaggle for providing this).
 
 
 Have fun
